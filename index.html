          <p>Fist is a fast, lightweight, full-text search and index server. Fist stores all information in memory making lookups very fast while also persisting the index to disk. The index can be accessed over a TCP connection and all data returned is valid JSON.</p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>Most software that requires full-text search is not really that complicated and does not need an overly complex solution. Using a complex solution often times leads to headaches. Setting up Elasticsearch when Elasticsearch really isn't needed for the particular application costs more time and money to maintain.</p>
          <p>This is where Fist comes in. Fist is intended to be extremely easy to deploy and integrate into your application. Just start the Fist server and start sending commands.</p>
